# possible improvements

- [ ] Rename records in original fasta/genbank assembled genome as `vialXX_timeYY_clZZ`?
- [ ] Group together correlated deletion trajectories that span adjacen intervals.
- [ ] Select trajectories based on delta (max - min) frequency on timepoints with high confidence.
- [x] Use secondary/supplementary reads to find duplicated/chimeric region bridges.
